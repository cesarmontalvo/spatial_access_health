Spatial access models to obtain Floating Catchment Areas

Floating Catchment Areas

Catchment area: area within which provider is accessible to people

Floating Catchment Areas (FCA)
Average number of doctors in a specific populated area

2 Step Floating Catchment Areas (2FCA)
Aggregation of doctors per population ratios in each catchment area

Enhanced 2 Step Floating Catchment Areas (E2FCA)
Aggregated ratios of doctors per population, weighted by distance or travel time. Weights are defined for the demand (population served). Closer distances, higher weights. 

3 Step Floating Catchment Areas (3FCA)
Extension of E2FCA that includes weights for physician locations. Weights are defined for the supply (doctors).
